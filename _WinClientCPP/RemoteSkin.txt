RemoteSkin sample

This sample demonstrates using a remoted Windows Media Player ActiveX control with a skin as the user interface. When you click Go to Media Library, the remoted control transitions to the Player and sets the current task pane as Media Libary. Double-clicking a media item in Media Library initiates a transition back to the remoting application and plays the selected file.
